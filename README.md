# MyReads 

MyReads is a simple organizer for all your reading needs.

Store the books you are reading, the ones you've already read and the ones you want to read later in three simple, interchangeable shelfs!

## Using MyReads:

### Managing your shelves

The main page will show the three bookshelves where you can store your books...

* Currently Reading
* Want to Read
* Read

 and all the books stored in each, including their covers (when available), name and author. 

You can change the shelf where a book is stored by clicking on the green button on the bottom-right corner of each thumbnail and choosing one of the options:

* Currently Reading
* Want to Read
* Read
* None

Chosing option 'None' will remove the book from your bookshelves.

To search for a book on the app's database, click on 'Add a book'.

### Searching for a book

Once at the search page, start typing on the search field for a keyword, book title or author.

While you type, the book options which match your search terms start appearing on the screen.

You send a book into one of your shelves by clicking on the green button on the bottom-right corner of each thumbnail and choosing one of the options:

* Currently Reading
* Want to Read
* Read
* None

To go back to the main page, click on the back arrow on the top-left corner of the page.
