### **Managing your shelves**

The main page will show the three bookshelves where you can store your books...

* Currently Reading
* Want to Read
* Read

 and all the books stored in each, including their covers (when available), name and author. 

You can change the shelf where a book is stored by clicking on the green button on the bottom-right corner of each thumbnail and choosing one of the options:

* Currently Reading
* Want to Read
* Read
* None

Chosing option 'None' will remove the book from your bookshelves.

To search for a book on the app's database, click on 'Add a book'.

### **Searching for a book**

Once at the search page, start typing on the search field for a keyword, book title or author.
